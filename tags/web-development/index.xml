      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t Break The Web As a web developer, I like to follow prominent people working in the web on twitter. It was there that I came across this exchange between Rich Harris, the creator of the web framework Svelte, and Jarred Sumner, the creator of the new javascript runtime Bun.
Smooshgate?
As much as I think people should have their own website, this exchange does highlight some of what&amp;rsquo;s great about social media.</description>
